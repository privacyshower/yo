<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>1.2   Contracting Entity</b></span></p>

Where this is the case, the relevant contracting entity will be identified in the relevant Yo! service-specific terms, and these Terms (and those relevant service-specific terms) will apply between you and that identified contracting entity in relation to your use of the relevant Yo! services or features.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>1.3   </b> <b>Service Eligibility</b> <b> </b></span></p>

You agree that you will have no claim against us for any statement which is not explicitly set out in these Terms. The words "include" and "including" are to be construed without limitation.

If a court holds that we cannot enforce any part of these Terms as drafted, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under applicable laws and regulations, without changing the remaining terms of these Terms. No delay in enforcing any provision of these Terms will be construed to be a waiver of any rights under that provision. Any rights and obligations under these Terms which by their nature should survive, including any obligations in relation to the liability of, or indemnities (if any) given by, the respective parties, will remain in effect after termination or expiration of these Terms.</span></p>
