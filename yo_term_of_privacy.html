Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications in the Yo! application is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). Yo! is not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>3.2 Transfer and Storage</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We operate and may continue to operate servers in a number of jurisdictions around the world, so the server on which your personal information is used and stored may not be in your jurisdiction.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2) Partners offering services in Yo!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your information may be accessed and used by our service providers who are working with us in connection with the operation of our services. These service providers may have access to your information but only to the extent necessary to perform services on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose that information or use it for any other purposes. These providers will collect the information sent by your mobile phone, tablet or desktop computer, and their use of that information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3) Law enforcement</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may share information about you if we are (or if we believe we are) required by law or legal process (such as a subpoena, warrant or court order), if we have to respond to a lawful request from legal authorities to disclose such information, or if we need to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service or our other policies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4) New owner</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we are acquired by a third party or may re-organise our group structure, your information may be transferred within our group and/or to a third party who will continue to operate Yo! or similar services under either this Privacy Policy or a different privacy policy which will be notified to you. The party to which your personal information is transferred may be located, and use your Information, outside of your jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other than as permitted under this Privacy Policy or as otherwise consented to by you or as required by law or legal process, we will not transfer your personal information to any other third parties for their processing for any purposes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>3.4</b> <b>Security Measures We Take to Protect Your Information</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, however, despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. In the event that your personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify you if your personal information has been compromised, as required by applicable law.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Where we do share your personal information with any third parties, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that such third parties only use your personal information: (i) in compliance with this Privacy Policy; and (ii) subject to any other instructions we give them, including any appropriate confidentiality and security measures that we implement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>4. How to Access Your Information</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can access and modify the information you provided to us through your account.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you believe your information posted on Yo! is not authentic or accurate and can provide us with reasonable proof regarding this, you can require us via the contact information provided in this Privacy Policy to correct these unauthentic or inaccurate information and we will use reasonable efforts to honour your request; however, we may retain an archived copy of your information as required by law and/or for record keeping purposes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once your account is closed or deleted, you will no longer have access to your message history, preferences or any other information associated with your use of our services. Even after you remove information from your account or profile, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere, to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. Additionally, we will retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce the Terms of Service. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In some cases, we may not be able to update, amend or remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know why we are unable to do so, for example, certain requests may require disproportionate technical effort or extremely impractical, or are prohibited by law.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since Yo! will be used in multiple jurisdictions and we may not be possible to identify all the inconsistency between certain terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable law in your jurisdiction, thus you agree to notify us once such inconsistency is identified by you. Under this circumstance we will take necessary methods to eliminate such inconsistency, including deleting these personal information improperly collected or used by us.</span></p>
